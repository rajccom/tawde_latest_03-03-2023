<p>In 1942-43, during the pre-independence era, when India was ruled by the British. a Maharashtrian in India, a Kshatriya Maratha surnamed Tawde from the Maratha community, received an honor. The National Institute of Science, a world-famous institution, honored Shri Nanasaheb Ramji Tawde (Sales), former Vice-Chancellor of Marathwada University, by giving him a scholarship for his extraordinary achievements in Physics. This single incident created a spark of pride in the hearts of many socially responsible "Tawde" surnamed people in Mumbai at that time.</p>

<p>During that period, under the chairmanship of his brother Shri Sitaram Ramji aka Dadasaheb Tawde (Educationist) from the discussion held together. On March 26, 1943, he was felicitated at the family level. Inspired by that, everyone felt they ought to do something for the Tawde family. It was decided that the Tawde congregation should do social service through mutual support, acquaintance, and interest. This led to the establishment of the "Kshatriya Maratha Tawde Beneficial Board" to perform the duties arising from it as per proper direction and trajectory. It took place on April 1943 at the residence of Shri Balkrishna Rajaram alias Bhausaheb Tawde.</p>
